Q1. Write a program to read in a text file and output the number of characters, words and lines it 
contains. Spaces, tabs, newlines and similar characters should all be counted as characters. 
Words should contain only a-z and A-Z. Hyphens, quotes, digits and any other characters are not 
part of a word. This means, for example, that words hyphenated like ‘on-time’ are treated as two 
words.
